It's handy carrying an emergency supply of health and armor with you right?
Gives the player Deployable Green Armor, a Deployable and more powerful Medikit
as well a standard Backpack. Everything a Marine needs to keep on fighting.
This is literally a life saver against Bosses, groups of harder enemies or
simply, when the going gets tough, but you can't get going...

The Deployable Armor, behaves exactly like Green Armour, it cannot replace
Mega-Armor and cannot be used if the current armor stats are over 100%.

The Deployable Medikit heals up to 50% instead of 25%.
Like Doom's Medikits it will only be used if your health is below 100%.
This makes it worth saving if there is already plenty of health available.

You can only carry 1 set of the Deployable Health & Armor.
If you haven't used either but collect another Supply Pack, you will just get
an extra Backpack, but you can restock anything that was used.
Again, this can help make saving the Health & Armor given more tactical.

Idea for this based on "Health Stations" I created & use on my own maps.
That can drop health & armor bonuses as well as being able to be refilled as
long as they don't run dry...

[GDLEF Notes]
Green Armor Light Def is added, as I have seen a non-fatal error message
//"GLDEFS object "SupplyPack" references undefined light "GREENARMOR1"
when testing this item. This is telling me the pre-existing Green Armor GLDef
needed is not configured or doesn't exist and stops you from seeing the
Green Glow from the armor in game. Users can keep the PointLight definition or
delete as they wish. I have left it in, incase you find the same errors,
without it. But I'd advise you to leave it as it is.

This is a visual effect & only works if using GZDoom or any other Program that
supports Open GLDef formats.
