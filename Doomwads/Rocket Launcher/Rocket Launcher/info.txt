After the invasion, the Union Aerospace Corporation went into weapons research,
trying to develop weapons to help the military fight off future invasions. Due to
Hell's tendency to swarm with individually weak creatures, branches were set up
specifically to find ways to counter this. One such counter is this, the HSTM-310
"HellStorm Cannon."

Based on standard rocket launcher technology which proved very effective during
the invasion, the HellStorm fires a cluster of impact grenades. Individually, each
impact grenade has only half the explosive potential of a rocket, but the entire
cluster has a total of four times the yield, easily able to clear a swarming group
or a more powerful demon with a single shot.

The drawback is that the weapon takes some skill to fire correctly. One mis-fire
could smear a careless marine across the walls, and the spread itself it difficult
to aim correctly. It also has a reload time greater than that of the rocket launcher,
and must reload after every shot.

Even with the drawbacks, the HellStorm Cannon is a powerful weapon in the UAC's
arsenal against future invasions.
