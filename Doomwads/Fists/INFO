Description: The Impactor Gauntlet was created with the aim to give space marines
a perminent powerful melee weapon in case they run out of ammo. This heavy beast
packs a serious punch which can knock back some foes when up close. This weapon also
includes a boost thruster which allows the wearer to speed forward a ways to
cross gaps and hit enemies multiple times, but deals significantly less damage.
With careful timing, the primary fire can even punch away projectiles!
